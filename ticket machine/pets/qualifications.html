<h3>Other personal content</h3>

<p> Participating in the international youth award has greatly expanded my knowledge by helping me
        engage and understand the needs of the less fortunate as well as opening my mind to how the
        business sector implements technology into their systems, as i worked with the IT department
        at Taj Pamodzi Hotel as well as Metallic motors. I was also elected as part of the student
        council to help improve the schooling standards as well as communication between students and
        school officials to help better the schooling environment. These together greatly benefited my
        teamwork, confidence and communication skills.</p>
         
       <p> For two years I had had worked in Bauleni compound which is a squatter settlement where
        residents reside in conditions in which there is no access to school, clean water or even
        housing just to name a few. Lack of education is one of the major contributors to poverty.
        Advances in technology can help greatly reduce poverty in regions like these, by helping in
        the education sector to get more people access to higher standards of education with which
        they may be able to earn more and have a better standard of living.
