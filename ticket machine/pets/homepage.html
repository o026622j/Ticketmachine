                <h1>Hello!, Im Adil.</h1>
                <h2>A students at staffordshire university</h2>
                <p id="para2">Currently based in Stoke-on-Trent studying computer science. </p>
                <p id="para3">Since the inception of the computer, the world has radically transformed from business to the
                        human body. The things that we are not doing with such great potential is what drives me to
                        want to do more. Taking up physics, chemistry, math and geography at A-level have helped me in
                        learning the basics in how computers function and how they can be implemented in the real
                        world. With the skills I gained from school and the vast amount of data available on the
                        internet I was able to develop my skills with which I had put into use as I endeavoured in
                        personal projects including, a couple basic swift and objective c applications.
                        Â 
                        Studying further in the field of technology, I hope to further my ambition to help alleviate
                        the difficulties that are posed upon the less fortunate as well as improve on technologies
                        that already exist.
                         </p>

                <p>As an aspiring student in the year 2018 I have always been surrounded by technology. It has
                        fascinated me how simply these technologies have integrated into our daily lives and have
                        always wondered how they really work. As I grew older and more understanding with the help of
                        schooling, my fondness for technology grew with me as discovering new technologies and how
                        they worked became a hobby. I also want to study in the field of technology because the demand
                        for jobs that are related to technology is growing at a ever fast rate, due Mo to the fact
                        technology is being integrated into every aspect of our life. The simplest of objects have
                        technology integrated into them and the need for technology to advance at a faster rate is
                        affecting the demand for jobs that are related to it.</p>
                <p>They will also need access to clean water, meat-based cat food and regular grooming as well as private access to a litter tray which should ideally be replaced once a week.</p>
